## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- Concurrent WebSocket write panic caused by multiple goroutines writing to the same connection
- Excessive "no NFC devices found" log spam when no device is connected

### Changed

- Device discovery moved to agent level for cleaner separation of concerns
- Agent now starts without a device and waits for device connection
- Hot plug-n-play support: devices are auto-discovered when plugged in and paths are cleared on disconnect
- Systray now reads device state from agent (agent is source of truth)
- "Refresh Devices" menu item now auto-selects first available device if none connected

### Removed

- Last scanned card is no longer sent to newly connected WebSocket clients
